Go playing microservice for use in BitBurner. To use, clone the repo, download Boost, and run the CMakeLists. It will build 2 executables, console.exe which is used to play against the AI in the terminal and microservice which runs a server on localhost:8080 which picks the best moves for a go game. To run it in BitBurner, copy the go.js file to the game and run it while the server is running.
